# Zemoga WordPress Test

## Page

**Name:** Zemoga page \
**URL:** ```{localURL}/zemoga-page```

## Template

Custom theme based on [wd_s](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wd_s) of Automattic's _s. \
**Theme Name:** zemoga

## Custom Plugin

**Plugin Name:** Wizard Form \
You can find the custom user form in the following path: ```{localURL}/form-registration```


## Installation

1. You can find the SQL db in the following path: ```wp-content/db_dump/zemoga_test.sql```

2. The default local URL in the database is: **http://localhost:8080/zemoga-test**, you must **update** these URLs to point to the local path (URL) you've created for the project.

## Final considerations

1. The page is completed as requested.
2. I have developed the plugin with the default fields that allows add the function **wp_insert_user**, additionally, the plugin was developed using AJAX and the latest standards for the plugin development.
I would really need more time to add custom fields to the WP User Registration and be able to create the multi-step wizard form. I was searching and working with some approaches but I really need more time to implement them successfully.
